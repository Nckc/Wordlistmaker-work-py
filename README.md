# Wordlistmaker-work-py

This is a simple program to make a text file into a word list that can be analyzed for vocabulary properties. To use it, you will need a .txt file. The output list will put each word of the text on a separate line.

It is possible to make such word lists in many ways, including just using Excel VBA. However, this project was one of my first in Python, and though it is very simple, it has been useful to me in my work.
